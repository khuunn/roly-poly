I built a bot for 5-min BTC markets using OpenClaw

$50 -> $823

This type of market has a crazy opportunity since every trade is basically 2x. If your win rate is above 50%, you can realistically scale to $10,000+

examples:
NickyNic /  +$82,000 in a day
profile: polymarket.com/@NickyNic?via=…

Xander-corvus2  /  +$102,299 in a day
profile: polymarket.com/@Xander-corvus…

These aren't some pro traders, two profiles were created just days ago, they just know how to use Fast-Loop properly

that's exactly why i built this bot
> scans arbitrage every 5 mins
> compares price with Binance and CoinGecko

The result is a fully automated 24/7 system - it catches the move before Polymarket reacts and enters first



BREAKING… the fastest 5m Polymarket Clawdbot setup just leaked

This is a REAL framework with REAL results.

Relevant for ANYONE active on Polymarket.

He started with a modest base, let Clawdbot manage execution, and scaled it to nearly ~$150K in returns

After breaking down the setup, I was honestly caught off guard
No narrative trades
No discretionary decisions
Everything functions fully automated

Execution is systematic, no human override

FULL strategy overview:

1. 5-minute BTC & ETH micro-arbitrage

The system targets short-duration Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts on 5-minute windows. In these rapid markets, temporary inefficiencies emerge when YES and NO pricing together fall below $1. With Moltbot (Clawdbot) integrated straight into Polymarket, those discrepancies are captured immediately - no predictions, no directional exposure, no bias

2. Speed over hesitation

When volatility spikes and manual traders freeze, the system executes. Orders fire automatically, without delay, emotion, or second-guessing. By the time participants react, the inefficiency is gone

3. Automation creates leverage

Each iteration collects small margins, not outsized wins. But continuous, high-frequency operation allows the cycle to repeat nonstop, without fatigue or slowdown - stacking incremental advantages into substantial outcomes

Scale is the advantage

8,894 trades. Individually insignificant. Collectively, they compounded into just ~$150K in gains

The takeaway

From where I stand, a quiet automation race has already begun on Polymarket

Humans argue over entries
Systems monetize structure
And as long as pricing inefficiencies exist, autonomous models will keep extracting value - silently, consistently

I monitor this niche closely. FOLLOW if you prefer signal over noise.
